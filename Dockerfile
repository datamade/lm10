# Extend the base Python image
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/python for version options
# N.b., there are many options for Python images. We used the plain
# version number in the pilot. YMMV. See this post for a discussion of
# some options and their pros and cons:

# Install any additional OS-level packages you need via apt-get. RUN statements
# add additional layers to your image, increasing its final size. Keep your
# image small by combining related commands into one RUN statement, e.g.,
#
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \ 
    build-essential postgresql postgresql-contrib gdal-bin \
    git make curl python3-pip poppler-utils

# Inside the container, create an app directory and switch into it
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python packages
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the contents of the current host directory (i.e., our app code) into
# the container.
COPY . /app
